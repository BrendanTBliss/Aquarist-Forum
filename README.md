# Aquarist-Forum

Project Scope:

This project’s main purpose is to be a place for fish keeping enthusiasts to get and share information about the hobby. Users will be able to create an account in which they can store and update a variety of personal information about their own tanks and fish. They will also be able to post questions about the hobby, and answers to other user’s questions.

Also included in the site will be an online marketplace where users can buy and sell livestock and aquarium equipment.

Some stretch goals for this site will be to include some fun features like a gallon calculator where users can post the dimensions of their tank and find out how many gallons of water the tank contains. Also, a compatibility function where users can input multiple species of livestock and see if they are compatible with each other.
